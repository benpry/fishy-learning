  In this experiment, a machine drops coins into buckets with different
  probabilities. Your goal is to learn how likely the coin is to be in each
  bucket. The experiment consists of four phases:
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
<ol>
  <li>Reading a message from a previous participant</li>
  <li>Completing learning trials</li>
  <li>Writing a message for the next participant</li>
  <li>Predicting how likely the coin is to be in each bucket</li>
</ol>
</p>

<hr/>

<p class="instructions-text">
    In the first phase of the experiment, you will <strong>read a message</strong> from a
  previous participant who saw the same buckets. The previous participant was
  instructed to write a message that helps you learn about the probabilities,
  but they only had ${messageWritingTime} seconds to write the message.
</p>

<hr/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will then learn more about how likely the coin is to be in each bucket
  through a series of <strong>learning trials</strong>. In each learning trial, one of the
  buckets will have a coin in it. You should <strong>click the bucket</strong> where you
  think the coin is, then you will see where the coin actually is.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The buckets all have the same probability of having the coin in every trial.
  The image below shows a learning trial where the coin is in the red bucket.

<p class="instructions-text">
  Finally, you will be asked to predict how likely a coin is to be in each
  bucket. Imagine a million coins were dropped into buckets, what percentage of
  them do you think would fall in each of the buckets?
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">You will make a prediction using this interface:</p>

/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The interface asks you to report your confidence along with probabilities. You
  should use the slider to adjust your confidence so that are <strong>95% sure</strong> that
  the true probability is in the shaded region. You will earn a <strong>bonus</strong> if the
  true probability is in the shaded region. Your bonus will be larger the
  smaller the region is.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Press "Next" when you are ready to see the message that a previous participant
  left for you.
