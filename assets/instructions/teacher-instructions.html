  In this experiment, you will play the role of a wildlife researcher who is
  studying fish populations in different ponds. You will visit four ponds that
  each have <strong>10 fish</strong> in them. There are different types of fish
  in each pond. Your goal is to learn about
  <strong>how many of each type of fish</strong> live in the ponds.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  At each pond, you will complete the following phases:
</p>

<ol class="instructions-text">
  <li>Catching and observing fish</li>
  <li>Composing a message for the next participant</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the pond</li>
</ol>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn a <strong>bonus</strong> that depends on the accuracy of your
  predictions and the predictions made by the participants who receive your
  messages.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  When you first arrive at a pond, you will go fishing. You will catch some fish
  and observe their colors. After catching a fish, you
  <strong>release it back into the pond</strong>. In this phase, you should
  click the fishing rod to go fishing. You will then see which type of fish you
  caught.

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will not be able to see the fish you caught after you release them, so
  make sure you <strong>remember which fish you caught</strong>.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  After catching some fish, you will need to leave the pond. Before you leave,
  you will have the opportunity to send a message to a future participant. The
  future participant has the same goal as you: to learn the distribution of fish
  in the pond.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will compose a message using an interface that lets you send symbols of
  the same colors as the fish in that pond. You will only be able to send a
  <strong>limited number of symbols</strong>, which might vary from pond to
  pond. Here is an example of the interface you use to send a message:

<p class="instructions-text">
  Your bonus will depend on the performance of the participants who read your
  messages, so make sure to send helpful messages!
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  Finally, you will report your beliefs. You will be asked to predict the most
  likely number of fish of each type in the pond, along with how much
  information you have for that belief. The prediction interface looks like
  this:
</p>

  style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn an
  <strong>individual bonus</strong> based on how close your prediction is to the
  true distribution of fish. Setting the information value higher will increase
  your bonus if your prediction is close to the true distribution, but decrease
  it if your prediction is far from the true distribution.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You can think of the amount of information as the
  <strong>total number of catches</strong> that inform your decision. For
  example, if you've caught four fish and have no other information, entering an
  information value of 4 will maximize your expected bonus.
