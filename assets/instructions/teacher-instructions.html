  In this experiment, you will play the role of a wildlife researcher who is
  studying fish populations in different ponds. You will visit four ponds that
  each have <strong>20 fish</strong> in them. There are different types of fish
  in each pond. Your goal is to learn about
  <strong>how many fish of each color</strong> live in the ponds.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  At each pond, you will complete the following phases:
</p>

<ol class="instructions-text">
  <li>Catching and observing fish</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the pond</li>
  <li>Composing a message for the next participant</li>
</ol>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn a <strong>bonus</strong> that depends on the accuracy of your
  predictions and the predictions made by the participants who receive your
  messages.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  When you first arrive at a pond, you will go fishing. You will catch some fish
  and observe their colors. After catching a fish, you
  <strong>release it back into the pond</strong>. In this phase, you should
  click the fishing rod to go fishing. You will then see which type of fish you
  caught.

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will not be able to see the fish you caught after you release them, so
  make sure you <strong>remember which fish you caught</strong>.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Next, you will report your beliefs. You will be asked to predict the most
  likely number of fish of each type in the pond, along with how much
  information you have for that prediction. The prediction interface looks like
  this:
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn an
  <strong>individual bonus</strong> that depends on how close your predicted
  numbers were to the true numbers and the information value you enter.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The value you enter in the information box deterimes the risk and potential
  reward of your predictions. If the numbers of fish you report are close to the
  true numbers, setting the information value high will increase your bonus. If
  the numbers you report are far from the true numbers, setting the information
  value high will decrease your bonus. Setting the information value low has the
  opposite effect.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You can think of the amount of information as the
  <strong>total number of catches</strong> that inform your decision. For
  example, if you've caught four fish and have no other information, entering an
  information value of 4 will maximize your expected bonus.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Finally, you will need to leave the pond. Before you leave, you will have the
  opportunity to <strong>compose a message</strong> for a future participant.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Your message will be initialized to the prediction you just made, but you will
  only be able to send a limited number of values. We have a limit of two for
  this example.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  We can click the buttons to hide and show certain values. For example, we can
  click the buttons for "white" and "information" to hide those values. We could
  send the following message:
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Your bonus will depend on the performance of the participants who read your
  messages, so make sure to send the most helpful message you can!
