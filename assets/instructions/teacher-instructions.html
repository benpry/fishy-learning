  In this experiment, you will play the role of a wildlife researcher who is
  studying fish populations in different lakes. You will visit six lakes that
  each have <strong>100 fish</strong> in them. There are different types of fish
  in each lake. Your goal is to learn about
  <strong>how many of each type of fish</strong> live in the lakes.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  At each lake, you will complete the following phases:
</p>

<ol class="instructions-text">
  <li>Catching and observing fish</li>
  <li>Writing a message for the next participant</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the lake</li>
</ol>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn a <strong>bonus</strong> that depends on the accuracy of your
  predictions and the predictions made by the participant who receives your
  message.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  When you first arrive at a lake, you will go fishing. You will catch a number
  of fish. After catching a fish, you
  <strong>release it back into the lake</strong>. In this phase, you should
  click the fishing rod to go fishing. You will then see which type of fish you
  caught.

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will not be able to see which type of fish you caught after you release
  them, so make sure you <strong>remember which fish you caught</strong>.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  After catching some fish, you will need to leave the lake. Before you leave,
  you will have the opportunity to <strong>write a message</strong> for a future
  participant.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The next participant will also try to learn the distribution of fish in the
  same lake. However, you will only be able to write
  <strong>small number of characters</strong>, which might vary form lake to
  lake. Different future participants might read different messages, so you
  can't assume that the same participant will read all of your messages.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Your bonus will depend on the performance of the participants who read your
  messages, so make sure to write helpful messages!
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  Finally, you will report your beliefs. You will be asked to report the
  distribution of fish you think is most likely, along with how confident you
  are in that prediction.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You can think of the confidence value as the
  <strong>total number of fish</strong> that are informing your decision, both
  those that you have observed and those you were told about. For example, if
  you've seen two fish and have no other information, setting the confidence
  value to 2 will maximize your expected bonus.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">The prediction interface looks like this:</p>

/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Equivalently, you can think of adjusting the confidence sliders so that there
  is a 50% chance the true number of fish falls within the range you specify.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn an
  <strong>individual bonus</strong> if the true numbers of fish fall in the
  range you specify. If you do get a bonus, it will be larger the smaller your
  range is. So it is important to set the confidence slider carefully!
