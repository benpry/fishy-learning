<p class="instructions-text">
  In this experiment, you will play the role of a wildlife researcher who is
  studying fish populations in different lakes. You will visit four lakes that
  each have <strong>100 fish</strong> in them. There are different types of fish
  in each lake. Your goal is to learn about
  <strong>how many of each type of fish</strong> live in the lakes.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">The experiment consists of three phases</p>

<ol class="instructions-text">
  <li>Catching and observing fish</li>
  <li>Writing a message for the next participant</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the lake</li>
</ol>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn a bonus that depends both on how accurately you predict the
  distribution of fish and how well the participant who receives your message
  does.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  When you first visit a lake, you will go fishing. You will catch a series of
  fish. After catching a fish, you
  <strong>release it back into the lake</strong>. In this phase, you should
  click the fishing rod to go fishing. You will then see which type of fish you
  caught.

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will not be able to see which type of fish you caught after you release
  them, so make sure you <strong>remember which fish you caught</strong>.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  After catching some fish, you will need to leave the lake. Before you leave,
  you will have the opportunity to <strong>write a message</strong> for the next
  participant.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The next participant will also try to learn the distribution of fish in the
  same lake. You should write a message that will help them do that. However,
  you will only have
  <strong>${messageWritingTime} seconds</strong> to write your message.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Your bonus will depend on the performance of the participant who reads your
  message, so make sure to write a helpful message!
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  Finally, you will report your findings. You will be asked to predict how many
  fish of each color there are in the lake, along with how confident you are in
  that prediction.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will make a prediction using an interface that looks like this:
</p>

<img
  src="../images/elicitation-screenshot.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the prediction interface"
  style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Adjusting the confidence slider will move the black bars. You should adjust
  them so that they cover a range that you are 50% sure contains the true
  numbers of fish. You will earn an
  <strong>individual bonus</strong> if the true numbers of fish fall in the
  range you specify. Your bonus will be larger the smaller your range is (i.e.
  the more confident you are in the prediction).
</p>

  alt="Screenshot of the prediction interface, with annotations"
  style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  It is important to set the confidence slider carefully. If you set it too
  high, you may miss getting a bonus. But if you set it too low, your bonus may
  be very small. You should think about how much evidence you have for your
  prediction and how likely it would be for the true numbers of fish to be
  outside of the range you specify.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  In the example above, the confidence slider is set so that the range is
  between 30 and 70 for both red and blue fish. This means you would be 50% sure
  that there are between 30 and 70 red fish and between 30 and 70 blue fish in
  the lake.
