  In this experiment, you will play the role of a wildlife researcher who is
  studying fish populations in different lakes. You will visit four lakes that
  each have <strong>100 fish</strong> in them. There are different types of fish
  in each lake. Your goal is to learn about
  <strong>how many of each type of fish</strong> live in the lakes.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">The experiment consists of two phases</p>

<ol class="instructions-text">
  <li>Catching and observing fish</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the lake</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  When you first visit a lake, you will go fishing. You will catch a series of
  fish. After catching a fish, you
  <strong>release it back into the lake</strong>. In this phase, you should
  click the fishing rod to go fishing. You will then see which type of fish you
  caught.

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will not be able to see which type of fish you caught after you release
  them, so make sure you <strong>remember which fish you caught</strong>.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  After catching some fish, it will be time for you to leave the lake and report
  your findings. You will be asked to predict how many fish of each color there
  are in the lake, along with how confident you are in that prediction.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will make a prediction using an interface that looks like this:

<p class="instructions-text">
  In addition to predicting proportions, you will be asked to specify a range
  that you are 95% sure contains the true numbers of fish. You will earn a
  <strong>bonus</strong> if the true numbers of fish fall in the range you
  specify. Your bonus will be larger the smaller your range is (i.e. the more
  confident you are in the prediction).
