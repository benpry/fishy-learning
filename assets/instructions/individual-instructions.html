  In this experiment, you will play the role of a wildlife researcher who is
  studying fish populations in different lakes. You will visit four lakes that
  each have 100 fish in them. There are different types of fish in each lake.
  Your goal is to learn about how many of each type of fish live in the lakes.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">The experiment consists of two phases</p>

<ol class="instructions-text">
  <li>Catching and observing fish</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the lake</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  When you first visit a lake, you will go fishing. You will catch a series of
  fish. You release the fish back into the lake after catching them. In this
  phase, you should <strong>click the fishing rod</strong> to go fishing. You
  will then see which type of fish you caught.

  You will not be able to see which type of fish you caught after you release
  them, so make sure you remember which fish you caught.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  After catching some fish, it will be time for you to leave the lake and report
  your findings. you will be asked to predict how many fish of each color their
  are in the lake. You should predict how many fish of each color are in the
  lake, along with how confident you are about that prediction.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will make a prediction using this interface:
