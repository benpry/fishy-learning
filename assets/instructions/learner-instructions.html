  In this experiment, you will play the role of a wildlife researcher who is
  studying fish populations in different ponds. You will visit four ponds that
  each have <strong>20 fish</strong> in them. There are different types of fish
  in each pond. Your goal is to learn about
  <strong>how many of each type of fish</strong> live in the ponds.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  At each pond, you will complete the following phases:
</p>

<ol class="instructions-text">
  <li>Viewing a message from a previous participant</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the pond</li>
  <li>Catching and observing fish</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the pond again</li>
  <li>Composing a message for the next participant</li>
</ol>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn a <strong>bonus</strong> that depends on the accuracy of your
  predictions and the predictions made by the participant who receives your
  message.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  When you a first arrive at a pond, you will read a message from a previous
  participant. That participant <strong>caught fish</strong> in the same pond
  and released them back to learn about the distribution of fish types.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The previous participant composed a message by specifying counts for different
  types of fish and an information value. The information value is described on
  the next page. They could
  <strong>only send a limited number of values</strong>. The message you receive
  will look like this:
</p>

<img src="../images/view-message-screenshot.png" alt="" style="width: 70%" />

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  After reading a message, you will report your beliefs. You will be asked to
  predict the most likely number of fish of each type in the pond, along with
  how much information you have for that belief. The prediction interface looks
  like this:
</p>

<img

  alt="Screenshot of the prediction interface"
  style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn an
  <strong>individual bonus</strong> based on how close your prediction is to the
  true distribution of fish. Setting the information value higher will increase
  your bonus if your prediction is close to the true distribution, but decrease
  it if your prediction is far from the true distribution.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You can think of the amount of information as the
  <strong>total number of catches</strong> that inform your decision. For
  example, if you've seen four fish and have no other information, entering an
  information value of 4 will maximize your expected bonus.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  Next, you will go fishing. You will catch some fish and observe their colors.
  After catching a fish, you
  <strong>release it back into the pond</strong>. In this phase, you should
  click the fishing rod to go fishing. You will then see which type of fish you
  caught.

<img src="../images/red-fish.svg" , alt="red fish" , style="width: 25%" />
<img src="../images/white-fish.svg" , alt="white fish" , style="width: 25%" />

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will not be able to see which type of fish you caught after you release
  them, so make sure you <strong>remember which fish you caught</strong>.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  Next, you will report your beliefs about the fish in the pond again using the
  same interface. Your individual bonus also depends on how well you predict the
  true distribution of fish in this stage.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  Finally, you will need to leave the pond. Before you leave, you will have the
  opportunity to <strong>compose a message</strong> for a future participant.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Your message will contain some of the values in the prediction interface. You
  will only be able to send a
  <strong>limited number of values</strong>, which might vary from pond to pond.
  Here is an example of the interface you use to create a message:
</p>

<img src="../images/compose-message-screenshot.png" alt="" style="width: 70%" />

<p class="instructions-text">
  You can toggle values by clicking the buttons. For example, you could click
  "cyan" if you want to send a count of cyan fish or click "red" to disable it
  if you do not want to send a count of red fish. You can also send an
  information value.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Your bonus will depend on the performance of the participants who read your
  messages, so make sure to write helpful messages!
