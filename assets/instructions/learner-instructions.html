  In this experiment, a machine drops coins into buckets with different
  probabilities. Another participant observed coins landing in different
  buckets. The experiment consists of two phases:
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
<ol>
  <li>Reading a message from the previous participant</li>
  <li>Predicting the probability of a coin landing in each bucket</li>
</ol>
</p>

<hr/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  In the first phase of the experiment, you will
  <strong>read a message</strong> from a previous participant who saw the same
  buckets. The previous participant was instructed to write a message that helps
  you learn about the probabilities, but they only had ${messageWritingTime}
  seconds to write the message.
</p>

<hr/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Next, you will be asked to predict how likely a coin is to be in each bucket.
  Imagine a million coins were dropped into buckets, what percentage of them do
  you think would fall in each of the buckets?
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">You will make a prediction using this interface:</p>

  style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The interface asks you to report your confidence along with probabilities. You
  should use the slider to adjust your confidence so that are
  <strong>95% sure</strong> that the true probability is in the shaded region.
  You will earn a <strong>bonus</strong> if the true probability is in the
  shaded region. Your bonus will be larger the smaller the region is.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Press "Next" when you are ready to see the message that a previous participant
  left for you.
