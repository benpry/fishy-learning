  In this experiment, you will play the role of a wildlife researcher who is
  studying fish populations in different ponds. You will visit four ponds that
  each have <strong>20 fish</strong> in them. There are different types of fish
  in each pond. Your goal is to learn about
  <strong>how many fish of each color</strong> live in the ponds.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  At each pond, you will complete the following phases:
</p>

<ol class="instructions-text">
  <li>Viewing a message from a previous participant</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the pond</li>
  <li>Catching and observing fish</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the pond again</li>
  <li>Composing a message for the next participant</li>
</ol>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn a <strong>bonus</strong> that depends on the accuracy of your
  predictions and the predictions made by the participant who receives your
  message.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  When you a first arrive at a pond, you will read a message from a previous
  participant. That participant <strong>caught fish</strong> in the same pond
  and released them to learn about the distribution of fish.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The previous participant composed a message by specifying counts for different
  types of fish and an information value. The information value is described on
  the next page. The previous participant could only send a
  <strong>limited number of values</strong>. The message you receive will look
  like this:
</p>

<img src="../images/view-message-screenshot.png" alt="" style="width: 70%" />

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  After reading a message, you will report your beliefs. You will be asked to
  predict the most likely number of fish of each type in the pond, along with
  how much information you have for that belief. The prediction interface looks
  like this:
</p>

<img
  src="../images/elicitation-screenshot.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the prediction interface"
  style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The values in the prediction interface will be initialized to the values in
  the message you received. You will earn an
  <strong>individual bonus</strong> that depends on how close your predicted
  numbers were to the true numbers and the information value you enter.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The value you enter in the information box deterimes the risk and potential
  reward of your predictions. If the numbers of fish you report are close to the
  true numbers, setting the information value high will increase your bonus. If
  the numbers you report are far from the true numbers, setting the information
  value high will decrease your bonus. Setting the information value low has the
  opposite effect.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You can think of the amount of information as the
  <strong>total number of catches</strong> that inform your decision. For
  example, if you've caught four fish and have no other information, entering an
  information value of 4 will maximize your expected bonus.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  Next, you will go fishing. You will catch some fish and observe their colors.
  After catching a fish, you
  <strong>release it back into the pond</strong>. In this phase, you should
  click the fishing rod to go fishing. You will then see which type of fish you
  caught.

<img src="../images/white-fish.svg" , alt="white fish" , style="width: 25%" />

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will not be able to see which type of fish you caught after you release
  them, so make sure you <strong>remember which fish you caught</strong>.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  Next, you will report your beliefs about the fish in the pond again using the
  same interface. Your prediction will be initialized to the values in your
  earlier prediction. Your individual bonus also depends on how well you predict
  the true distribution of fish in this stage.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  Finally, you will need to leave the pond. Before you leave, you will have the
  opportunity to <strong>compose a message</strong> for a future participant.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Your message will be initialized to the prediction you just made, but you will
  only be able to send a limited number of values. We have a limit of two for
  this example.
</p>

<img

  alt=""
  style="width: 70%"

<p class="instructions-text">
  We can click the buttons to hide and show certain values. For example, we can
  click the buttons for "white" and "information" to hide those values. We could
  send the following message:
</p>

  style="width: 70%"
/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Your bonus will depend on the performance of the participants who read your
  messages, so make sure to send the most helpful message you can!
