  In this experiment, you will play the role of a wildlife researcher who is
  studying fish populations in different lakes. You will visit four lakes that
  each have <strong>100 fish</strong> in them. There are different types of fish
  in each lake. Your goal is to learn about
  <strong>how many of each type of fish</strong> live in the lakes.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">The experiment consists of five phases</p>

<ol class="instructions-text">
  <li>Reading a message from a previous participant</li>
  <li>Catching and observing fish</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the lake</li>
  <li>Writing a message for the next participant</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the lake again</li>
</ol>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn a bonus that depends on how accurately you predict the
  distribution of fish.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  When you a arrive at a lake, you will read a message from a previous
  participant. That participant <strong>caught fish</strong> in
  the same lake and released them back to learn about the distribution of
  fish types.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The previous participant was instructed to write a message that helps you
  learn about the fish in the lake, but they were only able to write a limited
  number of characters.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  After reading a message, you will report your beliefs.
  You will be asked to predict how many fish of each color there are in the lake, along with how
  confident you are in that prediction.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will make a prediction using an interface that looks like this:
</p>

<img
  src="../images/elicitation-screenshot.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the prediction interface"
  style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Adjusting the confidence slider will move the black bars. You should adjust
  them so that they cover a range that you are 50% sure contains the true
  numbers of fish. You can think of the confidence value as the
  <strong>number of fish observed</strong>. For example, if you've seen two
  fish, setting the confidence value to two is a reasonable strategy.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn an
  <strong>individual bonus</strong> if the true numbers of fish fall in the
  range you specify. Your bonus will be larger the smaller your range is (i.e.
  the more confident you are in your prediction). So it is important to set the
  confidence slider carefully!
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  Next, you will go fishing. You will catch a number of fish. After catching a fish, you
  <strong>release it back into the lake</strong>. In this phase, you should
  click the fishing rod to go fishing. You will then see which type of fish you
  caught.
</p>

<img src="../images/blue-fish.svg" , alt="blue fish" , style="width: 25%" />

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will not be able to see which type of fish you caught after you release
  them, so make sure you <strong>remember which fish you caught</strong>.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  After catching some fish, you will need to leave the lake. Before you leave,
  you will have the opportunity to <strong>write a message</strong> for a future
  participant.
</p>


<p class="instructions-text">
  The next participant will also try to learn the distribution of fish in the
  same lake. However, you will only be able to send
  <strong>small number of characters</strong>, which might vary from lake to
  lake. Different future participants might read different messages, so you
  can't assume that the same participant will read all of your messages.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Your bonus will depend on the performance of the participants who read your
  messages, so make sure to write helpful messages!
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  Finally, you will report your beliefs about the fish in the lake again, using the same interface.
  You will also earn a bonus based on how well you predict the true distribution of fish in this stage.
</p>
