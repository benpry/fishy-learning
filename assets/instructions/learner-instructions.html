  In this experiment, you will play the role of a wildlife researcher who is
  studying fish populations in different lakes. You will visit four lakes that
  each have <strong>100 fish</strong> in them. There are different types of fish
  in each lake. Your goal is to learn about
  <strong>how many of each type of fish</strong> live in the lakes.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">The experiment consists of two phases</p>

<ol class="instructions-text">
  <li>Reading a message from a previous participant</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the lake</li>
</ol>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn a bonus that depends on how accurately you predict the
  distribution of fish.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  When you a arrive at a lake, you will read a message from a previous
  participant in this study. That participant <strong>caught fish</strong> in
  the lake and released them back afterward to learn about the distribution of
  fish types.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The previous participant was instructed to write a message that helps you
  learn about the fish in the lake, but they only had ${messageWritingTime}
  seconds to write the message.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  After reading the message, you will report your beliefs. You will be asked to
  predict how many fish of each color there are in the lake, along with how
  confident you are in that prediction.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will make a prediction using an interface that looks like this:
</p>

<img
  src="../images/elicitation-screenshot.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the prediction interface"
  style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Adjusting the confidence slider will move the black bars. You should adjust
  them so that they cover a range that you are 50% sure contains the true
  numbers of fish. You will earn an
  <strong>individual bonus</strong> if the true numbers of fish fall in the
  range you specify. Your bonus will be larger the smaller your range is (i.e.
  the more confident you are in the prediction).
</p>

  alt="Screenshot of the prediction interface, with annotations"
  style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  It is important to set the confidence slider carefully. If you set it too
  high, you may miss getting a bonus. But if you set it too low, your bonus may
  be very small. You should think about how much evidence you have for your
  prediction and how likely it would be for the true numbers of fish to be
  outside of the range you specify.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  In the example above, the confidence slider is set so that the range is
  between 30 and 70 for both red and blue fish. This means you would be 50% sure
  that there are between 30 and 70 red fish and between 30 and 70 blue fish in
  the lake.
