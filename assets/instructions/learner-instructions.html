  In this experiment, you will play the role of a wildlife researcher who is
  studying fish populations in different ponds. You will visit four ponds that
  each have <strong>10 fish</strong> in them. There are different types of fish
  in each pond. Your goal is to learn about
  <strong>how many of each type of fish</strong> live in the ponds.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  At each pond, you will complete the following phases:
</p>

<ol class="instructions-text">
  <li>Reading a message from a previous participant</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the pond</li>
  <li>Catching and observing fish</li>
  <li>Writing a message for the next participant</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the pond again</li>
</ol>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn a <strong>bonus</strong> that depends on the accuracy of your
  predictions and the predictions made by the participant who receives your
  message.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  When you a first arrive at a pond, you will read a message from a previous
  participant. That participant <strong>caught fish</strong> in the same pond
  and released them back to learn about the distribution of fish types.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The previous participant composed a message using symbols that were the same
  colors as the fish in the pond. For example, if the pond had cyan, red, and
  white fish in it, the previous participant's interface might look like this:
</p>

<img src="../images/message-screenshot.png" alt="" style="width: 50%" />

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  After reading a message, you will report your beliefs. You will be asked to
  predict the most likely number of fish of each type in the pond, along with
  how much information you have for that belief. The prediction interface looks
  like this:
</p>

<img
  src="../images/elicitation-screenshot.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the prediction interface"
  style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn an
  <strong>individual bonus</strong> based on how close your prediction is to the
  true distribution of fish. Setting the information value higher will increase
  your bonus if your prediction is close to the true distribution, but decrease
  it if your prediction is far from the true distribution.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You can think of the amount of information as the
  <strong>total number of catches</strong> that inform your decision. For
  example, if you've seen four fish and have no other information, entering an
  information value of 4 will maximize your expected bonus.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You can think of the confidence value as the
  <strong>total number of catches</strong> that are informing your decision,
  both those that you have observed and those you were told about. For example,
  if you've seen two fish and have no other information, setting the confidence
  value to 2 will maximize your expected bonus.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Next, you will go fishing. You will catch some fish and observe their colors.
  After catching a fish, you
  <strong>release it back into the pond</strong>. In this phase, you should
  click the fishing rod to go fishing. You will then see which type of fish you
  caught.

<img src="../images/blue-fish.svg" , alt="blue fish" , style="width: 25%" />

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will not be able to see which type of fish you caught after you release
  them, so make sure you <strong>remember which fish you caught</strong>.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  After catching some fish, you will need to leave the pond. Before you leave,
  you will have the opportunity to <strong>write a message</strong> for a future
  participant.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will compose a message using an interface that lets you send symbols of
  the same colors as the fish in that pond. You will only be able to send a
  limited number of symbols, which might vary from pond to pond. Here is an
  example of the interface you use to create a message:
</p>

<img src="../images/message-screenshot.png" alt="" style="width: 50%" />

<p class="instructions-text">
  Your bonus will depend on the performance of the participants who read your
  messages, so make sure to write helpful messages!
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  Finally, you will report your beliefs about the fish in the pond again, using
  the same interface. Your individual bonus also depends on how well you predict
  the true distribution of fish in this stage.
