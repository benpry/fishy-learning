  In this experiment, you will play the role of a wildlife researcher who is
  studying fish populations in different lakes. You will visit six lakes that
  each have <strong>100 fish</strong> in them. There are different types of fish
  in each lake. Your goal is to learn about
  <strong>how many of each type of fish</strong> live in the lakes.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  At each lake, you will complete the following phases:
</p>

<ol class="instructions-text">
  <li>Reading a message from a previous participant</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the lake</li>
  <li>Catching and observing fish</li>
  <li>Writing a message for the next participant</li>
  <li>Predicting the distribution of fish in the lake again</li>
</ol>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn a <strong>bonus</strong> that depends on the accuracy of your
  predictions and the predictions made by the participant who receives your
  message.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  When you a first arrive at a lake, you will read a message from a previous
  participant. That participant <strong>caught fish</strong> in the same lake
  and released them back to learn about the distribution of fish types.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The previous participant was instructed to write a message that helps you
  learn about the fish in the lake, but they were only able to write a limited
  number of characters.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  After reading a message, you will report your beliefs. You will be asked to
  report the distribution of fish you think is most likely, along with how
  confident you are in that prediction.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You can think of the confidence value as the
  <strong>total number of fish</strong> that are informing your decision, both
  those that you have observed and those you were told about. For example, if
  you've seen two fish and have no other information, setting the confidence
  value to 2 will maximize your expected bonus.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">The prediction interface looks like this:</p>

<img
  src="../images/elicitation-screenshot.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the prediction interface"
  style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Equivalently, you can think of adjusting the confidence sliders so that there
  is a 50% chance the true number of fish falls within the range you specify.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will earn an
  <strong>individual bonus</strong> if the true numbers of fish fall in the
  range you specify. If you do get a bonus, it will be larger the smaller your
  range is. So it is important to set the confidence slider carefully!
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  Next, you will go fishing. You will catch a number of fish. After catching a
  fish, you
  <strong>release it back into the lake</strong>. In this phase, you should
  click the fishing rod to go fishing. You will then see which type of fish you
  caught.

<img src="../images/blue-fish.svg" , alt="blue fish" , style="width: 25%" />

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will not be able to see which type of fish you caught after you release
  them, so make sure you <strong>remember which fish you caught</strong>.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  After catching some fish, you will need to leave the lake. Before you leave,
  you will have the opportunity to <strong>write a message</strong> for a future
  participant.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The next participant will also try to learn the distribution of fish in the
  same lake. However, you will only be able to send
  <strong>small number of characters</strong>, which might vary from lake to
  lake. Different future participants might read different messages, so you
  can't assume that the same participant will read all of your messages.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Your bonus will depend on the performance of the participants who read your
  messages, so make sure to write helpful messages!
</p>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  Finally, you will report your beliefs about the fish in the lake again, using
  the same interface. You will also earn a bonus based on how well you predict
  the true distribution of fish in this stage.
