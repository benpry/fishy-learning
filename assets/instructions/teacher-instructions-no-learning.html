  In this experiment, a machine drops coins into buckets with different
  probabilities. Your goal is to learn how likely the coin is to be in each
  bucket. The experiment consists of four phases:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reading a message from a previous participant</li>
  <li>Completing learning trials</li>
  <li>Writing a message for the next participant</li>
  <li>Predicting how likely the coin is to be in each bucket</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p class="instructions-text">
  In the first phase of the experiment, you will
  <strong>read a message</strong> from a previous participant who saw the same
  buckets. The previous participant was instructed to write a message that helps
  you learn about the probabilities, but they only had ${messageWritingTime}
  seconds to write the message.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will then learn more about how likely the coin is to be in each bucket
  through a series of <strong>learning trials</strong>. In each learning trial,
  one of the buckets will have a coin in it. You should
  <strong>click the bucket</strong> where you think the coin is, then you will
  see where the coin actually is.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The buckets all have the same probability of having the coin in every trial.
  The image below shows a learning trial where the coin is in the red bucket.

<p class="instructions-text">
  Finally, you will be asked to predict how likely a coin is to be in each
  bucket. Imagine a million coins were dropped into buckets, what percentage of
  them do you think would fall in each of the buckets?
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  You will make a prediction using this interface:
</p>

<img
  src="../images/elicitation-screenshot.png"
  alt="Elicitation Screenshot"
  style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
/>

<p class="instructions-text">
  The interface asks you to report your confidence along with probabilities. You
  should use the slider to adjust your confidence so that are
  <strong>95% sure</strong> that the true probability is in the shaded region.
  You will earn a <strong>bonus</strong> if the true probability is in the
  shaded region. Your bonus will be larger the smaller the region is.
</p>

<p class="instructions-text">
  Press "Next" when you are ready to see the message that a previous participant
  left for you.
